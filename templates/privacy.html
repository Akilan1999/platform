<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><i>Updated: [placeholder]</i></p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>To facilitate the ability of users to vote and create discussions, we create a unique 'voter ID'
  which is generated using the following information:
<ul>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>User-agent header</li>
  <li>Random number generated at that instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)"
      target="_blank">(pepper)</a>. This is not linked to the session ID</li>
</ul>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_blank">cryptographic hash</a> is created
using this
information in order to roughly identify a user, mitigating potential abuses of the anonymity granted through the
service.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
  Session cookies are used to generate a temporary username, allowing a user to comment anonymously. This session ID
  expires every 24 hours. No other information is stored in the browser.
</p>

<p>Examples of a session account:</p>

<div class="card">
  <h3 class="noTopMargin">Grateful Golang</h3>
  <p>Session ID: [placeholder]</p>

<div class="card">
  <h3 class="noTopMargin">Hateful Haskell</h3>
  <p>Session ID: [placeholder]</p>
</div>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
There's only one party happening here. No information is shared with third parties.

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We, the current class representatives, reserve the right to make any changes to this privacy policy. As we do not collect emails, notice will be given as an alert on the <a href="/">homepage</a>.</p>
