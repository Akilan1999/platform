</ul>

<p>An irreversable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"
  target="_blank">cryptographic hash</a> is created using this information in
order to roughly identify a user, allowing us to keep track of upvotes without
de-anonymising users. This hash is not linked with your session.</p>

<p>On the <a href="/complaints">complaints page</a>, users may leave an email
address if further correspondence is required. Complaints could not be linked
with the session, or any post under the ticketing system.</p>
