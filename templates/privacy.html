<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>To facilitate the ability of users to vote, we create a unique 'voter ID'
  which is generated using the following information:
<ul>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>User-agent header</li>
  <li>Random number generated at that instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)"
      target="_blank">(pepper)</a>. This is not linked to the session ID</li>
</ul>

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_blank">cryptographic hash</a> is created
using this
information in order to roughly identify a user, mitigating potential abuses of the anonymity granted through the
service.
</p>

<p>On the <a href="/complaints">complaints page</a> users may leave an email address if further correspondence is
  required.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
  Session cookies ("hithereimacookie") are used to generate a temporary username, allowing a user to comment anonymously
  and create
  discussions. This session ID
  expires every 24 hours.
</p>

<p>Examples of a session account:</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> to provide enhanced security to our
  service, thus you may notice another cookie called <a
    href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies"
    target="_blank">__cfduid</a> which is their anonymised cookie. This does not, however, track you between sites.</p>
